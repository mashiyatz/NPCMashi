# NPC Mashi

In the weeks leading up to my spring break, I (Mashi) spent an inordinate amount of time on the 4th floor of 370 Jay Street, working stubbornly on projects while disregarding the diminishing returns in productivity that one experiences after midnight. Only in retrospect did I realize that my time would have been better spent sleeping, hanging out with friends, or really anywhere else. This project is at once public self-mockery and public service message, currently displayed by the front desk of NYU ITP, featuring myself as an NPC, working at a desk in a surprisingly honest simulation of our space. Tap the NPC Mashi to hear a variety of quotes you might encounter as an ITP student. Click on the question mark in the corner to see a frank message displayed to passersby.
